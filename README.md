# 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation - Machine Learning Project

This project performs **customer segmentation** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**. It helps identify distinct groups of customers based on their **annual income** and **spending score**, which is useful for targeted marketing strategies.



## 📌 Project Steps

### 📥 Data Loading & Exploration

* Loaded dataset using **pandas**
* Explored data and visualized distributions
* Checked for missing values (none in this case)

### 🔧 Feature Selection

* Selected relevant features: `Annual Income (k$)` and `Spending Score (1-100)`
* Visualized feature relationships using scatter plots and pairplots

### 🤖 Clustering

* Applied **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters
* Used **KMeans algorithm** from scikit-learn to segment customers
* Labeled data based on clusters for analysis

### 📈 Visualization

* Visualized clusters using colored scatter plots
* Observed clear grouping among customer segments
